with operation

// This provides a much cleaner way to do everything with file
// Kind of syntactical sugar for all that try/catch blocks

with open(“hello.txt”) as f: 
    data = f.readlines()
    // or any other file operation

// we don't need to close the file this way since "with" does it for us, as soon as its block of code is over
