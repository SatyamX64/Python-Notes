Let there be a file called newFile.py

def fun():
    print('something')

def fun2():
    print('other')

x = 6


// Now to use the file from main.py

1.

import newFile as heh

heh.fun()
heh.fun2()
print(heh.x)

2.

from newFile import fun,fun2,x

fun()
fun2()
print(x)

or just use
from newFile import *
// to import everthing

// From is not suitable for bigger Projects, since it can creat ambiguity
